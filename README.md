## Feature List

- Yo a link!
- Recieve Yo's! (Chrome Notifications)
- AFK Mode! (Yo-to-Text)

## How to install

1. Clone the repo to your local machine


2. Get your own personal API key from the [Yo Developer Dashboard](http://dev.justyo.co/). Note that your Yo password is a numerical PIN just in case you forget what you entered when you first signed up.


3. If youd like to enable Chrome Yo Notifications, add this callback URL to your options on your [Yo Developer Dashboard](http://dev.justyo.co)
  - NOTE: using a callback url on your account reroutes all Yos, so if you're using that account on your phone as well, the phone will no longer receive Yos.


4. Point your Chrome browser to 'chrome://extensions' and check the box for 'Developer Mode'. Then, click on 'Load unpacked extension...', navigate to your 'app' folder and click 'Select'.


5. Open the extension's "Options" page, and fill it out with your info.
  - Your username and phone number are only necessary if youd like to enable Chrome desktop notifications and/or AFK mode.


6. Click on the purple box in the upper right hand of your browser and send a Yo! (recipient must follow your account in order to receive your YOs)
